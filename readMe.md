# Git/Github Notes

Note: use ctrl+shift+v to preview md files in VS Code

## Basic Concepts

1. **Repository (repo)**

   A project folder that Git is tracking. Can be **local** (on your computer) or **remote** (Like GitHub)

2. **Version Control**

   A system that tracks changes to code over time, letting you revert to previous versions or collaborate with others.

3. **Commit**

   A snapshot of your changes. Includes a message describing what was changed.

4. **Working Directory**

   The current state of your files on disk.

5. **Staging Area**

   Where you prepare changes before committing. You "stage" files that are ready to be committed.

---

6. `git init`

   Initializes a new Git repository in a folder.

7. `git status`

   Shows the current state of the working directory and staging area

8. `git add <file>`

   Stages changes in a file for the next commit. (note you can `git add *` to stage all files in the working directory, while `git add .` does the whole repository)

9. `git commit -m "message"`

   Saves the stages changes with a commit message.

10. **Add a remote location for a repo**

`git remote add origin <link to repo>`

11. `git push`

Sends local commits to the remote repository.
